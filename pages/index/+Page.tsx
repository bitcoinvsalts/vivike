        If you try to access the Admin Panel but you aren't logged in, then the <code>+guard.js</code> hook together
        with <code>throw render()</code> protects the page and renders the login page as fallback. Note how the URL{' '}
        <code>/admin</code> is preserved during the entire login flow.
      </p>
      <p>
        This page is hydrated: <Counter />
      </p>
    </>
